My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality for user authentication and authorization, sending email requests, and creating the various dashboards. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

• Developed user authentication services for registering and logging in users utilizing the IPrincipal and IIdentity types in
ASP.NET to assign specific claims for each user and used the BCrypt library to protect user passwords

• Built RESTful APIs using API controllers in .NET and designed services to communicate with SQL for storing and accessing
user information and managing tokens using ADO.NET

• Designed engaging interface for user login and register pages using React components and Bootstrap

• Implemented role-based routing on the app-level by filtering routes based on the current user's assigned roles 

• Added transactions and error messages in SQL to maintain an efficient flow of data in the server 

• Programmed email services using SendInBlue to send links with unique tokens to allow users to reset passwords or confirm
their accounts  

• Engaged in AGILE development by doing daily stand ups to go over goals, using Trello to develop sprints to complete work in
a specified time, and interacting with clients to discuss new functionality for the project.

• Used Git as source control to properly merge code through GitHub after successful peer code reviews to maintain coding
standards  

• Performed software testing and quality assurance to ensure smooth functioning of software and deliver a high-quality
product to end-users
